# The Monty Language
The monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes(just like python).
It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is
to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.
## Monty byte code files
Files containing Monty byte codes usuallly have the .m extension.
